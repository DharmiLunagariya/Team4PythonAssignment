* Introduction 
    - Titanic (Royal Mail Ship Titanic), was a British luxury passenger liner that sank on the 15th of April, 1912, during its voyage to New York City from Southampton, England. This lead to the death of about 1,500 passangers and to this day is seen as one of the most tragic incidents in history. 

    - In this project, we gathered insight about this catastrophe through the exploration of the [Titanic extended dataset (Kaggle + Wikipedia)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavlofesenko/titanic-extended) on Kaggle.

        We were able to find answers to questions regarding 

            1. How affluence affected survivability.
            2. Total survivals per age group.
            3. Did the bond of larger families influence survivability.
            4. Which states in the United States were passangers heading to, as well as total survival per state.
            5. The country of origins of these passangers and the total survival per home country.
            6. What were the most important variables in predicting a passangers survival
